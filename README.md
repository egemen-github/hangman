# hangman

This project is part of the [The Odin Project's Ruby](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/hangman) curriculum.

This is a Hangman Game where you are given a random word and try to guess all the letters that are in the given word. You have 6 lives and each mistake decreases your lives by -1 until 0. When no lives left, game over.
